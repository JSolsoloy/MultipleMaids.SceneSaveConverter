# MultipleMaids.PngSceneSave
Converts MultipleMaid.ini saves to images that have scene data in them and vice versa.
## Building
`ExIni.dll` is required. Place it in `/lib` folder and restore NuGet packages.

## Usage
Drag MultipleMaids.ini or already converted image files onto exe or provide them as command line arguments.

# What Can You Do With the Images?
* Look at them
* Convert them back to a MultipleMaids.ini 
* Convert the aforementioned ini back into images again
* Tinker with the images/ini and see what kind of exceptions the converter throws

You can't do anything with them just yet but I plan to make them readable in Multiple Maids
